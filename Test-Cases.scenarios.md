If I'm a Forest Ranger, to be able to calculate the price of littering tickets year round, it needs to work in below freezing tempuratures.  



If I'm a 1st grader, the calculator needs to be very easy to use, because I'm not as experienced with calculators.



As a college student, I need a calculator that doesn't run out of power, because if the battery dies I could fail a test.



As a small time lender, I need a calculator that is 100% accurate, because 1 small mistake could cost me big money.



As a house husband, I need a durable & easy calculator, so that I can use it for bills but not worry when my rowdy kids use it for homework.
