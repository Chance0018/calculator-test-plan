# **(6) Approach** #
>* * *
>### **(6.1) Overview** ###
>In order to test the product properly we have defined the intended User Base. Each test is designed to be able to test the product to its max limits & expectations. In order to meet this criteria we have created 3 major sections of testing & will follow sub-tests of each section for a thorough, relevent, & accurate results.
>
>### **(6.2) User Base** ###
>The User Base of this product is intended to be the average consumer. The products UI will have to be easy enough that the consumer can easily know and understand how to use the product out of the box, with no instruction or very little instruction needed. For testing we are expecting a large range of ages, ranging anywhere from 6 years old minimum with no expected max age limit. Consumers will expect the product to be able to do minimal calculations & also understand it is not intened for complex/advanced calculations.
>
>### **(6.3) Testing Types & Methods** ###
>**Internal Software:** A automatic software will be built in order to test the accuracy of the product, test for any limitation, check to make sure the software respects the limitations of the hardware, & it meets or exceeds the expectations/requirments provided. Test cases & scenarios will be used to tailor testing accuracte/relevent.  
>  
>**Physical Durability:** Testing the product with an environmental simulator will assist in verifying wheither or not the product meets or exceeds product owners spcifications provided. During the Physical Durability testing will also assure that the product meets saftey requirments & expectations. Test cases & scenarios will be used to tailor testing accuracte/relevent.
>  
>**User Interaction:** Test cases & scenarios will be heavily focused when testing User Interaction in order to make sure the products behaviors & ease of use are tested with relevent expectations. Testing will be mainly manual testing to get the most relevent results for the products responses or outputs are as expected/intended. Test cases & scenarios will be used to tailor testing accuracte/relevent.

# **(7) Criteria** #
>* * *
>### **(7.1) Passing Criteria** ###
>In order for behaviors, functions, features, durability, software, & other tests to meet passing criteria it needs to behave and/or respond correctly when referencing the product specifications, requirements, & expectations. Product criteria may exceed specifications, requirements, or expectations if it improves the user experience, specifications, requirements, or expectations as long as it does not hinder or cause other criteria to fail.
>
>### **(7.2) Fail Criteria** ###
>During testing if any behaviors, functions, features, durability, software, or other tests respond differently as intended, doesn't meet expectations, or hinders the product in any way the test will fail.
>* * *
# **(8) Suspension Criteria** #
>* * *
>### **(8.1) Overview** ###
>Product must be able to meet 100% of legal requirments/safety complience, 40% of the physical durability testing, user experience testing must meet 30% pass/completion, computing requires 100% accuracy anything less will suspend product testing. Testing & test completion will reference the products expected/assumed specifications and/or behaviors provided in specified documentation provided.
>
>### **(8.2) Resumption Criteria** ###
>To resume testing product computing requires 100% computing accuracy, physical duability must meet 100% of legal requirments/safety complience, other tests regarding durability, hardware, or user experience must be corrected to exceed suspension criteria or specifications, expectations, or requirnments must be updated to include results in pass criteria.

# **(13) Risk** #  
>* * *
>### **(13.1) Risks Identified** ###
>
>If hardware and/or user experience do not pass criteria testing will be halted. This may result in major delay in testing & schedule of the product outside of testing. Computing has a passing requirement of 100% anything less will result in test suspension.
>
>### **(13.2) Contingency Plan** ###
>
>Issues regarding hardware, physical durability, & user experience should be identified early in week 2 & dependant on resolution timeframe if within reason testing can continue by end of week 2 or begining of week 3. Dependant of situation we can flex hours scheduled in week 2 & flex them into week 3. If hardware or user experience does not pass criteria new Test Plan maybe created to continue testing internal software. 
>
>If Internal software does not meet full criteria hardware & user experience testing can continue & a seperate test can be done for the internal software before product release or as a update, patch, and/or hotfix at a later date.
